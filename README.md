*Color Road*

## Project Overview
*GUC, Winter 2018, CSEN903*

The purpose of this project was to create a small game where the player controls a colored sphere that moves forward automatically on an infinite floor. The floor is divided into three lanes and throughout their journey, the player encounters sphere collectibles and color changing zones. The goal of the game is to collect as many of the matching color spheres scattered throughout the game while avoiding the non-matching color spheres. When a player enters a color changing zone, the color of the playerâ€™s sphere changes. When a player collects a non matching color sphere, the player loses half of their score. The game ends when the score reaches zero.
